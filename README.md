### Motivation

ioeldev.com is my personal portfolio application I built to showcase my projects.

Next.js and styled components were used to build the fully responsive React application with form sanitation and validation done with custom react hooks.
I configured a custom SMTP proxy mailserver with MailGun so that I can receive and respond to emails as my hosted zone domain using my personal Gmail account.

### Technologies Used

- Next.js
- React
- Styled Components
- Express
- Mailgun
- Vercel
